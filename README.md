## Assignment 1 - Writing your own Shell

=============================================================================

## Project overview.

The DPUShell is a unix shell, it has similar functionality to the bash shell. 
It provides a way of interacting and manipulating the Filesystem to execute programs.
In addition to executing CLI Binaries, the DPUShell has the ability to redirect STDIN, STDOUT to files on the FS.
Job delegation and controls are supported. Please see the list of details below

Redirection Command list
- '<' # read
- '>' # write
- '>>' # append

Usage Examples
- < bar /bin/cat
- /bin/ls < foo
- /bin/bug -p1 -p2 foobar
- cat>bar<README

Builtin Commands
- cd {{dir}}
- ln {{src}} {{dest}}
- rm {{file}}
- exit
- jobs # lists all running jobs
- fg {{job id}} # bring a job to the foreground (example: fg 1 or fg 2) ** note no %1, %2 like in bash


## Assumptions made, if any.

- The maximum read/write buffer sizes are 1024
- Jobs can have 3 states, Foreground running, background running, background stopped
    - SIGINT will be propogated to the process groupt causing the child to revieve it
    - SIGTSTP should behave to stop the currently running foreground process if any
    - SIGCHLD will be given once a process has completed, which in turn should kill the child process
- Redirection Assumptions
    - Canâ€™t have two input redirects on one line
    - When no redirection file is specified, returns an error
    - Cannot have >>> or more [>]
    - When redirection from nothing - should return an error
- Interprocess communication & pipe Assumptions
    - When dup2 is called to duplicate a filedescriptor, the original fd can be closed
- When the shell starts it will open up in the users home directory
- 

## Any Design decisions you had to make or issues you faced, in brief. 4. Summary (include any specific new learnings, if possible).








In order to achieve a separation of logical ideas

USED this as a template for my fork() and interprocess communication: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9405985/linux-3-0-executing-child-process-with-piped-stdin-stdout

** burned like 2 hours on SIGTSTP * SIGSTOP

signals - tried to do it this way -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31097058/sending-signal-from-parent-to-child
but that is the old way to do it, now it has to be this way ->

## Setting up your development Environment

- OS : ubuntu-16.04.3-server-amd64.iso
- Download ISO URL : https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server
- Credentials
    - UN: root
    - PW: Test1234!
    - UN: ninja
    - PW: Test1234!
- Project directory is mounted in /srv under DPUShell

##OS Installation/Configuration Instructions

- During Installation Partition with LVM
- Install ssh server (either during installation or via apt-get)
    - apt-get install openssh-server 
- Setup root password (Test1234!)
- Setup SSH for root (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) -> PermitRootLogin yes
- As root install VirtualBox guest Additions ** needed for mounting shared directories 
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms
    - apt-get install zlib1g-dev // this adds in the zconf.h header file, needed to have variable arguments (...)
    - apt-get install -y dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r)
    - follow this tutorial: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-a-gui-less-ubuntu-server-host/
        - To mount the CD start the virtual machine and go to devices within the host machine menu
    - mkdir /srv/DPUShell ** this will create a directory to mount the project to 

** reboot the server

##VirtualBox Setup (Version 5.1.26 r117224 (Qt5.6.2))

Setup Networking (varies per machine)
 
- Networking 
    - Enable Network adapter
    - Set Network adapter to "Bridged adapter"
    - Set Permiscuous Mode setting to Allow All
    - Set to cable connected
- Shared Folders
    - Add a shared folder (Folder path is the path of your project)
    - Folder Name is "DPUShell"
    - Select "Auto-mount" & "Make Permanent"
    - add the following entry to /etc/fstab "/media/sf_DPUShell /srv/DPUShell none defaults,bind 0 0"
        - ** That entry will automatically mount on startup, to test for correctness run "mount -a" 

# Test your OS/VMWare installation/configuration
- Reboot the VM 
- You should be ready to Develop on this project from your local machine
- Tests to make sure you setup your environment correctly
    - cd /srv/DPUShell
        - ls (do you see the contents for the project)
    - run ifconfig to get the IP address
    - try to ssh into the running vm from your local machine "ssh root@{{your vm ip address}}"
    - try to ssh into the running vm from your local machine "ssh ninja@{{your vm ip address}}"
   
   
# Setup your test shell for the 'ninja' user account

** you need cmake 3.8.2

- cd ~
- wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.8/cmake-3.8.2.tar.gz
- tar -xvf cmake-3.8.2.tar.gz
- cd cmake-3.8.2.tar.gz
- ./bootstrap
- make
- make install

--- 

# Setting up the ninja user
- run /srv/DPUShell/build/build_install.sh, to cmake, build and setup the existing ninja users shell

** for testing purposes, setup ssh key access for the ninja user saves you a lot of time by not having to enter in your password

# Development and Testing

- IDE: CLion (2017.2.2)
- You can either develop directly on the linux machine or develop locally via the shared directory in Virtualbox
- After coding to test your changes, run the /srv/DPUShell/build/build_install.sh script
    - This will build and deploy your shell as the default shell for the test user
- ssh into the vm as ninja@x.x.x.x and your shell will execute
- repeat the process
